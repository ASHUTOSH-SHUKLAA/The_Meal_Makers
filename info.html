            <h2>The Impact of Food Waste</h2>
            <p>Globally, around one-third of the food produced for human consumption is wasted. This is not just a waste of food, but also a waste of valuable resources such as water, energy, and labor. At the same time, millions of people are going hungry. Reducing food waste can play a significant role in solving hunger issues and fighting climate change.</p>
